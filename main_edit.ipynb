    "- theoretical background enough? Should focus rather on model or estimation method?\n",
    "- how much explanations additional to code really necessary? Rather focus on code documentation or on interpretation of results?\n",
    "- Code:\n",
    "    - Structure: Are classes the right way to go? When, when not?\n",
    "    - Should we try to use numba? Apparently we would need to go back to for-loops for that\n",
    "    - What about pandas? We do not use as much data as example project and present less of it. Also we fear performance issues. On the other hand it is nicer to handle and display.\n",
    "- In general: How much effort should go into this project? FOr us it is more like a toy project to have a base implementation of a structural model and the corresponding estimation, in order to obtain some experience for future research and the possible development of such models."
